• Hypokalemia  hyperaldosteronism  
• Look through available CT abdomen for adrenal masses  
 Refer young hypertensive patients and patients with signs of secondary hypertension to 
IMPT for work up prior to surgery  (discuss with surgeon regarding benefit of 
postponing operation for further work up vs risk of delaying surgery)  
 Low threshold for referral to IMPT for young hypertensives  
 If no suspicion of secondary hypertension, manage as for pre -existing hypertension  
 
PERIOPERATIVE OPTIMIZATION OF MEDICATIONS  
 Continue all anti-hypertensives on the day of operation except ACEi/ARB (refer to below)   
 Take with sip of water at 6am on day of surgery 
 Beta-blockers  
 Patients with ≥ 3 revised cardiac risk index ( RCRI)  factors or intermediate/high cardiac 
risk on preoperative tests, it may be reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery – 
discuss with cardiologist or PEC consultant if it should be started  
 Beta blockers should not be initiated within 24h of surgery 
 Diuretics  
 Watch out for hypokalemia and evaluate patient’s volume status on the day of operation  
 Angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/ Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs)  
 ACEi can cause refractory post induction hypotension if not stopped preoperatively  
 In non-cardiac surgery, consider discontinuation 24 hours preoperatively and restart within 48 hours after operation in patients with well controlled hypertension unless 
clinically contraindicated  
 Continue ACEi preoperatively  if there is impaired LV systolic function or heart 
failure or if BP is poorly controlled

1. BACKGROUND  
a. Obesity is a relatively common condition, that can have a profound impact on 
morbidity/mortality and anesthesia. Careful attention should be given to airway anatomy 
and the potential physiological derangements.  
b. Communication: non -pejorative, while not avoiding important risks and issues, aiming to 
avoid distress and allow bette r communication with patient and relatives.  
2. ASSESSMENT  
FOR BODY MASS INDEX >35  
i. HISTORY  
1. Cardio status – Hypertension, Ischaemic Heart Disease, Effort tolerance, Symptoms of 
heart failure, deep vein thrombosis  
2. Respiratory status – Screen for  Obstructive Sleep Apnea using STOPBang tool (if high risk 
for moderate -severe OSA , refer OSA protocol ),  Asthma  
3. Gastro -esophageal reflux, Diabetes Mellitus  
4. Airway – Review old records for history of difficult intubations  
ii. EXAMINATION  
1. Airwa y – Mouth opening, Mallampati, Neck extension and circumference  
2. Dentition – loose, crowns and bridges  
iii. INVESTIGATIONS  
1. Bloods – FBC/UE,  CREAT,  GLU  
2. ECG – specifically looking for – LV hypertrophy or strain, RBBB or Rt axis deviation, P -

- If ACT score ≤19 (not well controlled), r efer IMPT (if patient is on  
OPS follow -up) or RCCM (if patient is known to them ) for 
optimi sation.  If surgery is non -urgent, discuss postponement with 
PEC consultant and surgeon.  
- Continue inhalers both pre and postoperatively  and advise patient 
to bring inhalers on the day of surgery . 
 
5. PREHABILITATION  
 
a. Prehabilitation  is the process of enhancing an individual’s functional capacity to enable 
him/her to better withstand upcoming surgical stressors. In SGH,  the PeriopeRativE 
PrograAm foR Elderly (PREPARE) encompasses a multimodal approach to target  frail 
elderly patients presenting for elective major abdominal surgery . 
 
b. All preoperative patients >65 years are screened at the Nursing Assessment Counter with  
the Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS) for frailty, and Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool 
(MUST)  for malnutrition risk

o No prescription of p re-operative carbohydrate drink as these patients 
are considered to have higher aspiration risks.  
3. Optimization of medical comorbidities  
o Iron -deficiency anemia . If present, and anemia is moderate in nature 
(Hb <=11 g/dL), to refer to IMPT (internal medicine  perioperative 
team) for suitability of IV iron treatment  
o Smoking. Encourage  reduction or even cessation.  
o Other medical comorbidities . If present, to be referred to either  SGH 
obstetric anaesthetic group  or IMPT or other appropriate medical 
disciplines  
4. Reinforcement of preoperative physiotherapy education by Preoperative 
Evaluation Clinic nurses   
Intraoperative   
 Anaesthesia 
technique   Regional anaesthesia  (RA)  may be preferred over general anaesthesia, in the 
absence of contraindications.  
 Rationale: RA  is associated with lower maternal blood loss, lower aspiration 
risks,  less maternal and fetal  sedation after surgery which increases 
opportunity for maternal bonding with the infant.  
 Volume 
management   Perioperative and intraoperative euvolemia should be achieved.  
 Intravenous fluids should be administered to preload the circulation . 
 Consider left lateral uterine displacement.  
 In non-pre-eclamptic  patients who received regional anaesthesia, vasopressors 
should be routinely, and even prophylactically.2  
a. Alpha -agonist drugs (phenylephrine) are the most appropriate agents 
to treat hypotension after spinal anaesthesia  in a recent consensus 
statement . 
b. Small doses of ephedrine are suitable to support the blood pressure 
when there is bradycardia.  
c. Maternal heart  rate may be used as a surrogate for cardiac output, 
when cardiac output is not being monitored. Both tachycardia and 
bradycardia should be avoided.   
d. Phenylephrine infusions may be required to maintain the systolic 
blood pressure at 90% of baseline.  
e. In pre -eclamptic patients, the above vasopressors treatment should be 
titrated to BP.  
 
 Antibiotic 
prophylaxis   Within 30min ideally, and not more than 60min prior to surgical incision , and 
topped up regularly during surgery, or earlier if blood loss > 1.5L

You are the anesthesiologist seeing this patient in the preoperative clinic two weeks prior to the date of operation. The patients have already taken their routine preoperative investigations and the findings are listed within the clinical summary. 
Your role is the evaluate the clinical summary and give the preoperative anesthesia instructions for the following patient targeted to your fellow medical colleagues. You are to follow strictly the department's guidelines. 

Your instructions should consist of the following components:
1. Should the patient be seen by a Doctor or a Nurse (Doctor or Nurse)
2. Fasting instructions - list instructions based on the number of hours before the time of the listed surgery 
3. Suitability for preoperative carbohydrate loading (Yes or No)

5. Any instructions for the healthcare team:
   - Consider preoperative blood group matching in case of potential blood transfusion during surgery.
   - Ensure the availability of a standby post-operative high dependency/ICU bed given the patient's history of severe OSA on CPAP.

6. Any preoperative optimization required for the patient:
   - The patient's diabetes management should be optimized. Ensure the patient's blood sugar is well-controlled leading up to the surgery.

7. Any need to delay the operation for further medical workup and preoperative optimization: No

8. Any specific department protocols to follow for this patient:
   - Follow the department's standard protocols for anesthesia and perioperative care. Given the patient's history of severe OSA on CPAP, ensure that appropriate measures are taken to manage and monitor the patient's airway during surgery. Be prepared for potential challenges related to the patient's airway.

Instructions for the patient in lay language:
1. Medication instructions to take leading up to the surgery:
   - Continue to use your Ventolin inhaler as needed for your asthma symptoms. Use it as you normally do on the day of surgery.

2. Consent for the types of anesthesia and specific risks:
   - You will receive anesthesia to keep you comfortable during surgery. Due to your history of severe sleep apnea, our team will take extra precautions to ensure your airway is managed well during the procedure. This may involve using specialized equipment to monitor your breathing closely. We will do our best to keep you safe and comfortable throughout the surgery.

Please follow all fasting instructions provided to you, and be sure to inform the medical team of any changes in your health leading up to the surgery.","**Doctor or Nurse**: Doctor

**Fasting Instructions**: 
- Solids: Fast for 6 hours before the time of surgery.
- Clear liquids: Patient may have clear liquids until 2 hours before the time of surgery.

**Suitability for preoperative carbohydrate loading**: No 

**Medication Instructions**: 
- Ventolin: Continue as needed (PRN), especially on the morning of surgery with sips of water. Ensure the patient brings the inhaler to the hospital on the day of surgery. 

**Instructions for the Healthcare Team**: 
- Ensure that the patient has her CPAP machine with her, as it may be needed immediately postoperatively.
- Monitor blood glucose levels closely both preoperatively and postoperatively, optimizing as necessary.
- Standby post-operative high dependency/ICU beds due to severe OSA and elevated HbA1c.

**Preoperative Optimization Required**: 
- Optimize diabetes control with the Internal Medicine Perioperative Team (IMPT). The patient's HbA1c is 9.4% and needs to be optimized prior to surgery.
- The patient may require a referral to the Pulmonology or Sleep Medicine Team for OSA management and perioperative planning.

**Delay Operation for Further Medical Workup and Preoperative Optimization**: 
- Yes, delay operation to allow time for diabetes optimization and possibly adjust CPAP settings. Consultation with IMPT, Pulmonology, or Sleep Medicine may also necessitate a delay.

**Specific Department Protocols to Follow**: 
- Guidelines on Preoperative Assessment of Obese Patients: The patient has a BMI of 34.2; ensure adherence to preoperative assessment guidelines relevant to obese patients. This includes careful attention to airway management, positioning, and other considerations outlined in the protocol.
- Preoperative assessment of Respiratory Disease: Given the patient's history of severe OSA, Asthma, and upcoming surgery, adhere to the preoperative assessment guidelines for patients with respiratory disease presenting for elective surgery.

**Instructions to the Patient in Lay Language**: 

**1. Medication Instructions Leading Up to Surgery**: 
- You can continue using your Ventolin inhaler as you normally do, especially on the morning of your surgery. Please bring the inhaler with you on the day of the surgery. 

**2. Consent for Types of Anesthesia**: 
- You will likely have anesthesia that makes you sleep during the procedure. Since you have sleep apnea, asthma, and diabetes, there are some additional risks. For sleep apnea, there’s a risk of breathing problems during and after the surgery, so we will monitor you closely and you might need to use your CPAP machine right after the surgery. Because of your asthma, there's a small risk of having an asthma attack, but you can use your inhaler to prevent this. The anesthesia team will discuss the specific types of anesthesia that are safe for you and will ask for your consent for the planned anesthesia approach. We will take every precaution to manage these risks and keep you safe during your operation.","Based on the clinical summary provided, the following are the preoperative anesthesia instructions for the patient:

• Hypokalemia  hyperaldosteronism  
• Look through available CT abdomen for adrenal masses  
 Refer young hypertensive patients and patients with signs of secondary hypertension to 
IMPT for work up prior to surgery  (discuss with surgeon regarding benefit of 
postponing operation for further work up vs risk of delaying surgery)  
 Low threshold for referral to IMPT for young hypertensives  
 If no suspicion of secondary hypertension, manage as for pre -existing hypertension  
 
PERIOPERATIVE OPTIMIZATION OF MEDICATIONS  
 Continue all anti-hypertensives on the day of operation except ACEi/ARB (refer to below)   
 Take with sip of water at 6am on day of surgery 
 Beta-blockers  
 Patients with ≥ 3 revised cardiac risk index ( RCRI)  factors or intermediate/high cardiac 
risk on preoperative tests, it may be reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery – 
discuss with cardiologist or PEC consultant if it should be started  
 Beta blockers should not be initiated within 24h of surgery 
 Diuretics  
 Watch out for hypokalemia and evaluate patient’s volume status on the day of operation  
 Angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/ Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs)  
 ACEi can cause refractory post induction hypotension if not stopped preoperatively  
 In non-cardiac surgery, consider discontinuation 24 hours preoperatively and restart within 48 hours after operation in patients with well controlled hypertension unless 
clinically contraindicated  
 Continue ACEi preoperatively  if there is impaired LV systolic function or heart 
failure or if BP is poorly controlled

1. PURPOSE  
 To promote individualized assessment and counselling of perioperative cardiac risks for  
patients  listed  for non -cardiac surgery  
 To provide guidelines for referrals and investigations for patients with cardiac conditions going 
for both elective and  emergency surgery  
 To guide pharmacological management of patients on medications for their cardiac conditions  
2. STANDARD  
 Recommendations are based on current best evidence summarized in the references below, 
with consideration of the prevailing practices in  this institution.  
 Management decisions should be based on the individual patient and in consultation with the 
attending surgeon, anesthetist and cardiologist.  
 
3. PERIOPERATIVE CARDIAC ASSESSMENT (ACC/AHA 2014)  
 
Many patients undergoing major non -cardiac surgery are at risk for a cardiovascular event. The 
risk is related to both patient - and surgery - specific characteristics. Identification of any increased 
risk provides the patient, surgeon and anaesthetist with information to formulate risk-benefit ratio 
of the procedure. The surgeon provides surgery -specific risks, and the anesthetists  counsel s for both 
patient - and anaesthesia - specific risks, which can be very different from surgical risks.  
 
Procedure risk str atification  
 
 Life or limb -threatening emergencies  when  there is time for no or limited clinical 
evaluation, typically within 6h : 
i. Proceed, institute measures to maintain coronary perfusion and cardiac 
output  
ii. Refer to CVM for postoperative evaluation and management  
 
 Elective surgery  
i. To consider time frame available for preoperative optimization  
 Time -sensitive procedure: one in which a delay of > 1h to 6 weeks to allow 
for an evaluation and significant changes in management will negatively 
affect outcome  (e.g. malignancy, critical limb ischemia, carotid 
endarterectomy, infections)  
 Elective procedure: procedure could be delayed for up to 1 year

2. Consent for anesthesia: You will be given anesthesia for your surgery. The anesthesia team will discuss the type of anesthesia with you and any specific risks associated with it. Please feel free to ask them any questions you may have.

These instructions are final, and it is essential to follow them to ensure a safe and successful surgery. If you have any concerns or questions, please discuss them with your healthcare team.","### Medical Colleague Instructions:

1. **Doctor or Nurse:** Doctor.
2. **Fasting Instructions:** The patient should fast for at least 6 hours for solids and 2 hours for clear liquids before the time of surgery.
3. **Preoperative Carbohydrate Loading:** Yes.
4. **Medication Instructions:** NA (The patient is not on any chronic medications).
5. **Instructions for the Healthcare Team:** NA.
6. **Preoperative Optimization Required:** The patient should quit smoking or at least reduce smoking leading up to the surgery to improve postoperative pulmonary function and wound healing. 
7. **Delay Operation for Further Medical Workup/Optimization:** NA.
8. **Specific Department Protocols:** 
   - Guidelines on Preoperative Cardiac Assessment: Considering the patient’s past referral for abnormal ECG and the nature of the ACL reconstruction surgery, this guideline should be followed to ensure cardiac risks are appropriately assessed and managed. The patient has a normal echocardiogram from 2013, but due to his smoking history, a comprehensive assessment following the cardiac assessment guideline will be crucial for patient safety.

### Patient Instructions:

1. **Medication Instructions:** You don’t have any regular medications to take, but please inform us if you take any over-the-counter medicines, supplements, or herbal products in the days leading up to your surgery. 
2. **Consent for Types of Anesthesia:**
   - You will likely receive general anesthesia for your ACL reconstruction surgery. This means you’ll be asleep and won't feel anything during the procedure. 
   - There are risks associated with anesthesia, such as allergic reactions and breathing difficulties, but these are rare. Your anesthesiologist will discuss these with you in more detail on the day of your surgery.
   - It’s important to follow fasting instructions to reduce the risk of complications during anesthesia. This means you shouldn't eat or drink anything for the specified time before your surgery.
   - Since you have a smoking history, it’s crucial for you to understand that smoking can increase the risk of respiratory complications. Consider quitting or reducing smoking as much as possible before your surgery to minimize these risks.

### Consent for Surgery and Anesthesia:
You are scheduled for ACL reconstruction, which is a common and generally safe procedure. However, all surgeries carry some risks. Here are things you should be aware of:

- **General Risks:** Infection, bleeding, blood clots, or reactions to anesthesia.
- **Specific Risks due to Smoking:** Smokers may face higher risks of breathing problems during or after surgery and slower healing process.

Your surgeon and anesthesiologist will explain the procedure and the associated risks in more detail. You’ll have the opportunity to ask questions. If you understand and agree to proceed, you’ll be asked to sign a consent form.","Based on the information provided, here are the preoperative anesthesia instructions for the patient:

Should the patient be seen by a Doctor or a Nurse?

Any instructions for the healthcare team - for example, preoperative blood group matching, arranging for preoperative dialysis, or standby post-operative high dependency/ICU beds:
The patient's medical history indicates that they have chronic kidney disease and are on hemodialysis. Therefore, the healthcare team should ensure that the patient's dialysis is adequately timed and performed before the surgery to prevent any complications. Additionally, the healthcare team should be prepared to manage any postoperative complications related to the patient's kidney disease.
Any preoperative optimization required for the patient - list what needs to be optimized:
The patient's hypertension and chronic kidney disease need to be optimally managed before the surgery to reduce the risk of perioperative complications. The healthcare team should ensure that the patient's blood pressure is well-controlled and that their kidney function is adequate for the surgery.
Any need to delay the operation for further medical workup and preoperative optimization?
No, there is no need to delay the operation for further medical workup and preoperative optimization based on the information provided.
Any specific department protocols to follow for this patient - name as many as necessary, and give short reasoning for using these protocols:
a. Cardiology protocol: The patient has a history of hypertension, which increases the risk of perioperative cardiac complications. Therefore, the cardiology department should be consulted to ensure that the patient's blood pressure is well-controlled before the surgery.

• Look through available CT abdomen for adrenal masses  
 Refer young hypertensive patients and patients with signs of secondary hypertension to 
IMPT for work up prior to surgery  (discuss with surgeon regarding benefit of 
postponing operation for further work up vs risk of delaying surgery)  
 Low threshold for referral to IMPT for young hypertensives  
 If no suspicion of secondary hypertension, manage as for pre -existing hypertension  
 
PERIOPERATIVE OPTIMIZATION OF MEDICATIONS  
 Continue all anti-hypertensives on the day of operation except ACEi/ARB (refer to below)   
 Take with sip of water at 6am on day of surgery 
 Beta-blockers  
 Patients with ≥ 3 revised cardiac risk index ( RCRI)  factors or intermediate/high cardiac 
risk on preoperative tests, it may be reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery – 
discuss with cardiologist or PEC consultant if it should be started  
 Beta blockers should not be initiated within 24h of surgery 
 Diuretics  
 Watch out for hypokalemia and evaluate patient’s volume status on the day of operation  
 Angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/ Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs)  
 ACEi can cause refractory post induction hypotension if not stopped preoperatively  
 In non-cardiac surgery, consider discontinuation 24 hours preoperatively and restart within 48 hours after operation in patients with well controlled hypertension unless 
clinically contraindicated  
 Continue ACEi preoperatively  if there is impaired LV systolic function or heart 
failure or if BP is poorly controlled

cardiac/pulmonary conditions, or oximetry on air is <93% – consult senior anaesthetist (rule 
out lung disease and/or obesity hypoventilation syndrome)  
2. Assess the need for SICU/ICA b ooking postop  
3.  Inform Principal Anaesthetist on Friday (once duty roster is out)

Anaesthesia Protocol for ERAS Spine  
 
Pre-op (At PAC)  
 
- Optimize Hb (as per Anaemia protocol)  
- Optimize DM control if HbA1c > 8.5% (refer to IMPT as per DM protocol)  
- Smoking cessation counselling (preferably 4 weeks before surger y) 
- Identify patients with chronic opioid usage  and inform surgeon  (they may not be suitable for 
ERAS)  
 
On the day of surgery  (To be prescribed at PAC ) 
 
- Carbohydrate  drink 2 hours before surgery if no contraindications (BMI >35, reflux, diabetes 
mellitus)  
- Patients already on gabapentinoids should continue taking it perioperatively  
 
On the day of surgery (To be prescribed at DS/SDA)  
 
- All EXCEPT  ACDF and TLIF surgeries: PO Arcoxia 120mg with PO omeprazole , unless 
contraindicated .  
- Contraindications include drug allergy to NSAIDs/Cox2 -inhibitors/aspirin, renal 
impairment, history of GI ulcers or bleeds,  ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular 
disease, peripheral arterial disease, and moderate to severe heart failure . 
 
Intra -op 
 
1. Analgesia  
- Consider IV ketamine bolus  0.2-0.3mg/kg at induction  
- IV Paracetamol 1g at the end of surgery  
 
2. Antibiotic prophylaxis  
- IV antibiotics at start of surgery  
 
3. PONV prophylaxis  
- IV Dexamethasone 8mg at start of surgery  if non -diabetic  
- If diabetic  (well controlled HbA1c<8) , change to IV Dexamethasone 4mg  
- If diabetic (poorly controlled HbA1c≥8), to omit. Consider TIVA instead  
- IV ondansetron 8mg at the end of surgery  
 
4. IV fluids  
- IV fluids : aim normovolemia  
 
5. IV Tranexamic Acid  (TXA)  1g at the start of surgery  (if no patient contraindication)  
- Contraindications include (but not limited to): allergy to TXA, active intravascular 
clotting, patients at risk of thrombotic  complications e.g. procoagulant disorders, 
previous DVT / PE

Guidelines on Preoperative Cardiac Assessment  Document No:  
 Page 1 of 9 
Issued By: Perioperative Services, Dept of 
Anaesthesiology (Dr Angie Au Yong, Dr Hairil Rizal 
Bin Abdullah)  
Date Issued: 23/4/2020  
Version number: 4 Approved By:  
Dr Tan Kian Hian , HOD,  Division of 
Anaesthesiology and Perio perative Medicine  
 
 
 
1. PURPOSE  
 To promote individualized assessment and counselling of perioperative cardiac risks for  
patients  listed  for non -cardiac surgery  
 To provide guidelines for referrals and investigations for patients with cardiac conditions going 
for both elective and  emergency surgery  
 To guide pharmacological management of patients on medications for their cardiac conditions  
2. STANDARD  
 Recommendations are based on current best evidence summarized in the references below, 
with consideration of the prevailing practices in  this institution.  
 Management decisions should be based on the individual patient and in consultation with the 
attending surgeon, anesthetist and cardiologist.  
 
3. PERIOPERATIVE CARDIAC ASSESSMENT (ACC/AHA 2014)  
 
Many patients undergoing major non -cardiac surgery are at risk for a cardiovascular event. The 
risk is related to both patient - and surgery - specific characteristics. Identification of any increased 
risk provides the patient, surgeon and anaesthetist with information to formulate risk-benefit ratio 
of the procedure. The surgeon provides surgery -specific risks, and the anesthetists  counsel s for both 
patient - and anaesthesia - specific risks, which can be very different from surgical risks.  
 
Procedure risk str atification  
 
 Life or limb -threatening emergencies  when  there is time for no or limited clinical 
evaluation, typically within 6h : 
i. Proceed, institute measures to maintain coronary perfusion and cardiac 
output  
ii. Refer to CVM for postoperative evaluation and management  
 
 Elective surgery  
i. To consider time frame available for preoperative optimization  
 Time -sensitive procedure: one in which a delay of > 1h to 6 weeks to allow 
for an evaluation and significant changes in management will negatively 
affect outcome  (e.g. malignancy, critical limb ischemia, carotid 
endarterectomy, infections)  
 Elective procedure: procedure could be delayed for up to 1 year

Fasting is required for 6 hours prior to the scheduled surgery time. The patient should not eat or drink anything solid after midnight the night before surgery. Clear fluids, such as water, black tea, and black coffee, are allowed up to 2 hours before surgery.

Suitability for preoperative carbohydrate loading (Yes or No):
No, as the patient has a high risk of hypoglycemia due to their medication and medical history.

Medication instructions - name each medication and give the instructions for the day of the operation and days leading up to the operation as required:
a. Paracetamol 1g TDS: Continue taking as prescribed until the day of surgery.
b. Pregabalin 60mg OM: Stop taking 48 hours before surgery.

Any instructions for the healthcare team - for example, preoperative blood group matching, arranging for preoperative dialysis, or standby post-operative high dependency/ICU beds:
a. Preoperative blood group matching is recommended to ensure appropriate blood products are available in case of an emergency.
b. No preoperative dialysis is required.
c. Standby post-operative high dependency/ICU beds should be arranged due to the patient's age and medical history.

Any preoperative optimization required for the patient - list what needs to be optimized:
a. Optimize blood glucose control to reduce the risk of hypoglycemia during surgery.
b. Consider referral to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management of the patient's cardiac conditions.

Any need to delay the operation for further medical workup and preoperative optimization?
Yes, the patient should be referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation and management of their cardiac conditions before proceeding with the surgery.

Any specific department protocols to follow for this patient - name as many as necessary, and give short reasoning for using these protocols:
a. Singapore General Hospital's Guidelines on Preoperative Cardiac Assessment should be followed to ensure individualized assessment and counseling of perioperative cardiac risks for patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.
b. The patient should be monitored closely for signs of hypoglycemia during the surgery, and appropriate measures should be taken if necessary.

Instructions to the patient in lay language:

Medication instructions leading up to the surgery: Continue taking paracetamol as prescribed until the day of surgery. Stop taking pregabalin 48 hours before surgery.
Consent for types of anesthesia: The patient should be aware of the risks and benefits of general anesthesia and be willing to undergo it if necessary for the surgery.
Risks to highlight due to the operation and the patient's medical history:
a. Hypoglycemia during surgery due to medication and medical history.
b. Cardiac events due to the patient's cardiac conditions.. ",,,

• Look through available CT abdomen for adrenal masses  
 Refer young hypertensive patients and patients with signs of secondary hypertension to 
IMPT for work up prior to surgery  (discuss with surgeon regarding benefit of 
postponing operation for further work up vs risk of delaying surgery)  
 Low threshold for referral to IMPT for young hypertensives  
 If no suspicion of secondary hypertension, manage as for pre -existing hypertension  
 
PERIOPERATIVE OPTIMIZATION OF MEDICATIONS  
 Continue all anti-hypertensives on the day of operation except ACEi/ARB (refer to below)   
 Take with sip of water at 6am on day of surgery 
 Beta-blockers  
 Patients with ≥ 3 revised cardiac risk index ( RCRI)  factors or intermediate/high cardiac 
risk on preoperative tests, it may be reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery – 
discuss with cardiologist or PEC consultant if it should be started  
 Beta blockers should not be initiated within 24h of surgery 
 Diuretics  
 Watch out for hypokalemia and evaluate patient’s volume status on the day of operation  
 Angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/ Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs)  
 ACEi can cause refractory post induction hypotension if not stopped preoperatively  
 In non-cardiac surgery, consider discontinuation 24 hours preoperatively and restart within 48 hours after operation in patients with well controlled hypertension unless 
clinically contraindicated  
 Continue ACEi preoperatively  if there is impaired LV systolic function or heart 
failure or if BP is poorly controlled

o No prescription of p re-operative carbohydrate drink as these patients 
are considered to have higher aspiration risks.  
3. Optimization of medical comorbidities  
o Iron -deficiency anemia . If present, and anemia is moderate in nature 
(Hb <=11 g/dL), to refer to IMPT (internal medicine  perioperative 
team) for suitability of IV iron treatment  
o Smoking. Encourage  reduction or even cessation.  
o Other medical comorbidities . If present, to be referred to either  SGH 
obstetric anaesthetic group  or IMPT or other appropriate medical 
disciplines  
4. Reinforcement of preoperative physiotherapy education by Preoperative

Intraoperative   
 Anaesthesia 
technique   Regional anaesthesia  (RA)  may be preferred over general anaesthesia, in the 
absence of contraindications.  
 Rationale: RA  is associated with lower maternal blood loss, lower aspiration 
risks,  less maternal and fetal  sedation after surgery which increases 
opportunity for maternal bonding with the infant.  
 Volume 
management   Perioperative and intraoperative euvolemia should be achieved.  
 Intravenous fluids should be administered to preload the circulation . 
 Consider left lateral uterine displacement.  
 In non-pre-eclamptic  patients who received regional anaesthesia, vasopressors 
should be routinely, and even prophylactically.2  
a. Alpha -agonist drugs (phenylephrine) are the most appropriate agents 
to treat hypotension after spinal anaesthesia  in a recent consensus 
statement . 
b. Small doses of ephedrine are suitable to support the blood pressure 
when there is bradycardia.  
c. Maternal heart  rate may be used as a surrogate for cardiac output, 
when cardiac output is not being monitored. Both tachycardia and 
bradycardia should be avoided.   
d. Phenylephrine infusions may be required to maintain the systolic 
blood pressure at 90% of baseline.  
e. In pre -eclamptic patients, the above vasopressors treatment should be 
titrated to BP.  
 
 Antibiotic 
prophylaxis   Within 30min ideally, and not more than 60min prior to surgical incision , and 
topped up regularly during surgery, or earlier if blood loss > 1.5L

o If patients sc ore >=2, and, to raise referral to dietitian in PEC for 
preoperative nutritional optimization.  
3. Minimization of fasting  
o Pre-operative carbohydrate drink to be taken the evening before 
surgery and 2 hours before surgery if no contraindications (obesity, reflux, diabetes mellitus)  
o Rationale: preoperative carbohydrate treatment is associated with reduced post -operative insulin resistance, enhanced return of bowel 
function, and shorter hospital stay with no effect on post -operative 
complication rates. Insufficient studies on its use in obese / diabetic patients.  
4. Optimization of medical comorbidities  
o Iron-deficiency anemia . If present, and anemia is moderate in nature 
(Hb <=11 g/dL), to refer to IMPT (internal medicine perioperative team) 
for suitability of IV iro n treatment . To discuss with surgeon to consider 
delaying surgery for 2-4 weeks for haemoglobin response to treatment.  
o Menorrhagia with severe anemia . If present to discuss with surgeons if 
patient may be suitable for GnRH agonists in conjunction with 
hema tinics and to consider delay ing surgery for 2-4 weeks  for 
haemoglobin response to treatment to minimize blood transfusion  
o Other medical comorbidities . If present, to be referred to either IMPT 
or other appropriate medical disciplines  
5. Reinforcement of preoperative physiotherapy education by Preoperative 
Evaluation Clinic nurses  
Intraoperative   
• Volume 
management  • Perioperative goal -directed fluid therapy reduces length of stay and 
complications in high -risk patients undergoing abdominal surgery. 
• Pain 
management  1. Opioid sparing techniques  
a. IV paracetamol 1 g -  If no liver impairment or child’s A liver cirrhosis. 
Consider 500mg in Child’s B/C cirrhosis  
b. IV parecoxib 40mg -  Avoid in patients with creatinine clearance <30ml/min, 
Child’s B/C cirrhosis, history of peptic ulcer disease, decompensated heart 
failure or ischemic heart disease  
c. Lignocaine infusion  
i. Loading dose of 1 -1.5mg/kg followed by 1 -1.5 mg/kg/hr infusion 
intraoperatively.  
ii. Consider early discontinuation intraoperatively eg . after completion 
of resection, if a wound catheter will be inserted or LA infiltration

===Medications===
Keppra 
Paracetamol 
Tramadol PRN ","Here are the preoperative anesthesia instructions for the patient scheduled for Hysterectomy based on the provided clinical summary:

1. Should the patient be seen by a Doctor or a Nurse (Doctor or Nurse):
   - Doctor

2. Fasting instructions - list instructions based on the number of hours before the time of the listed surgery:
   - NPO (nothing by mouth) for at least 6 hours before surgery for solids.
   - Clear fluids (water, clear juice, black tea or coffee without milk) can be consumed up to 2 hours before surgery.

3. Suitability for preoperative carbohydrate loading (Yes or No):
   - No

4. Medication instructions - name each medication and give the instructions for the day of the operation and days leading up to the operation as required:
   - Keppra (Levetiracetam): Continue as prescribed leading up to the day of surgery.
   - Paracetamol: Continue as prescribed leading up to the day of surgery.
   - Tramadol PRN: Continue as prescribed leading up to the day of surgery. Administer only if necessary for pain relief on the day of surgery.

5. Any instructions for the healthcare team - for example, preoperative blood group matching, arranging for preoperative dialysis, or standby post-operative high dependency/ICU beds:
   - Preoperative blood group matching is not required based on the information provided.

6. Any preoperative optimization required for the patient - list what needs to be optimized:
   - The patient's hemoglobin (Hb) level is low (9.3 g/dL). Consider optimizing the patient's hemoglobin level if possible, such as with iron supplements or blood transfusions, before the surgery to reduce the risk of perioperative anemia.

7. Any need to delay the operation for further medical workup and preoperative optimization?
   - Consider delaying the surgery if the patient's hemoglobin level cannot be improved within the two-week period. Ensure that the patient's Hb level is rechecked before making a final decision.

8. Any specific department protocols to follow for this patient - name as many as necessary, and give short reasoning for using these protocols:
   - Consider using a department-specific protocol for patients with low Hb levels to optimize their hemoglobin levels before surgery, as this can reduce the risk of perioperative complications.

Instructions for the patient in lay language:

1. Medication instructions to take leading up to the surgery:
   - Please continue taking your medications, including Keppra, Paracetamol, and Tramadol (only if needed for pain), as prescribed by your doctor. Do not stop any of these medications without your doctor's approval.

2. Consent for the types of anesthesia that the patient needs to be aware of for this surgery, and any specific risks to highlight due to the operation and the patient's medical history:
   - Your surgery will be performed under general anesthesia, which means you will be asleep and not feel any pain during the procedure. There are common risks associated with anesthesia, such as nausea, vomiting, and a sore throat after waking up. Given your medical history of epilepsy, please inform the anesthesia team about your condition, as they will take measures to ensure your safety during anesthesia. Additionally, because your hemoglobin level is low, there is a risk of anemia-related complications, so efforts will be made to optimize your hemoglobin level before surgery to minimize these risks.

Please ensure that these instructions are communicated to the patient and that any further medical workup and optimization are conducted as necessary before the scheduled surgery.","### For Medical Colleagues

1. **Doctor or Nurse**: Doctor
2. **Fasting Instructions**: 
   - Solid foods: No solid foods for at least 8 hours prior to surgery.
   - Clear liquids: The patient may have clear liquids until 2 hours prior to the surgery.
3. **Preoperative Carbohydrate Loading**: No
4. **Medication Instructions**:
   - **Keppra (Levetiracetam)**: Continue as prescribed without interruption.
   - **Paracetamol**: Discontinue on the day of surgery. Resume postoperatively as needed for pain control.
   - **Tramadol**: Withheld on the day of the surgery. Resume postoperatively as needed for pain control.
5. **Instructions for the Healthcare Team**:
   - Consider preoperative crossmatching due to low hemoglobin levels.
   - Arrange for postoperative monitoring in a high dependency unit due to patient's age, low hemoglobin, and comorbidities.
6. **Preoperative Optimization Required**:
   - Optimize hemoglobin levels if possible, consider iron supplementation or transfusion if necessary and appropriate.
   - Preoperative consultation with a neurologist regarding her epilepsy management might be beneficial.
7. **Delay Operation for Further Workup & Optimization**: NA
8. **Specific Department Protocols**: 
   - **Elderly Patient Protocol**: Due to patient’s age, ensure careful monitoring and support for physiological functions, and adjust drug dosages as necessary.
   - **Epilepsy Management Protocol**: Continue antiepileptic medication and have an action plan for potential perioperative seizure.

### For the Patient

1. **Medication Instructions**:
   - Continue taking your Keppra (Levetiracetam) as usual.
   - Do not take Paracetamol or Tramadol on the day of the surgery. You may resume taking them as needed for pain relief after the surgery.
   - Remember to fast: do not eat solid foods for at least 8 hours before your surgery, and you can have clear liquids until 2 hours before the surgery.

2. **Consent and Risks**:
   - We plan to use anesthesia that will make you sleep comfortably during the surgery (general anesthesia). Because of your epilepsy, there is a slight increase in the risk of having a seizure during or after the surgery. However, continuing your Keppra medication will help minimize this risk.
   - Other general risks include reactions to anesthesia, bleeding, infection, and the specific risks associated with a hysterectomy. We will do everything we can to minimize these risks and manage any that do occur.

Please ensure you understand all instructions and risks, and feel free to ask any questions you may have.","Based on the clinical summary provided, here are the preoperative anesthesia instructions for the patient:

• Look through available CT abdomen for adrenal masses  
 Refer young hypertensive patients and patients with signs of secondary hypertension to 
IMPT for work up prior to surgery  (discuss with surgeon regarding benefit of 
postponing operation for further work up vs risk of delaying surgery)  
 Low threshold for referral to IMPT for young hypertensives  
 If no suspicion of secondary hypertension, manage as for pre -existing hypertension  
 
PERIOPERATIVE OPTIMIZATION OF MEDICATIONS  
 Continue all anti-hypertensives on the day of operation except ACEi/ARB (refer to below)   
 Take with sip of water at 6am on day of surgery 
 Beta-blockers  
 Patients with ≥ 3 revised cardiac risk index ( RCRI)  factors or intermediate/high cardiac 
risk on preoperative tests, it may be reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery – 
discuss with cardiologist or PEC consultant if it should be started  
 Beta blockers should not be initiated within 24h of surgery 
 Diuretics  
 Watch out for hypokalemia and evaluate patient’s volume status on the day of operation  
 Angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/ Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs)  
 ACEi can cause refractory post induction hypotension if not stopped preoperatively  
 In non-cardiac surgery, consider discontinuation 24 hours preoperatively and restart within 48 hours after operation in patients with well controlled hypertension unless 
clinically contraindicated  
 Continue ACEi preoperatively  if there is impaired LV systolic function or heart 
failure or if BP is poorly controlled

Bin Abdullah)  
Date Issued: 23/4/2020

Dr Tan Kian Hian , HOD,  Division of 
Anaesthesiology and Perio perative Medicine  
 
 
 
1. PURPOSE  
 To promote individualized assessment and counselling of perioperative cardiac risks for  
patients  listed  for non -cardiac surgery  
 To provide guidelines for referrals and investigations for patients with cardiac conditions going 
for both elective and  emergency surgery  
 To guide pharmacological management of patients on medications for their cardiac conditions  
2. STANDARD  
 Recommendations are based on current best evidence summarized in the references below, 
with consideration of the prevailing practices in  this institution.  
 Management decisions should be based on the individual patient and in consultation with the 
attending surgeon, anesthetist and cardiologist.  
 
3. PERIOPERATIVE CARDIAC ASSESSMENT (ACC/AHA 2014)  
 
Many patients undergoing major non -cardiac surgery are at risk for a cardiovascular event. The 
risk is related to both patient - and surgery - specific characteristics. Identification of any increased 
risk provides the patient, surgeon and anaesthetist with information to formulate risk-benefit ratio 
of the procedure. The surgeon provides surgery -specific risks, and the anesthetists  counsel s for both 
patient - and anaesthesia - specific risks, which can be very different from surgical risks.  
 
Procedure risk str atification  
 
 Life or limb -threatening emergencies  when  there is time for no or limited clinical 
evaluation, typically within 6h : 
i. Proceed, institute measures to maintain coronary perfusion and cardiac 
output  
ii. Refer to CVM for postoperative evaluation and management  
 
 Elective surgery  
i. To consider time frame available for preoperative optimization  
 Time -sensitive procedure: one in which a delay of > 1h to 6 weeks to allow 
for an evaluation and significant changes in management will negatively 
affect outcome  (e.g. malignancy, critical limb ischemia, carotid 
endarterectomy, infections)  
 Elective procedure: procedure could be delayed for up to 1 year

3.4. If patients  have any symptoms of a low blood sugar  such as sweating, dizziness, blurred 
vision or shaking , they should test their capillary blood glucose (CBG)  when they are able  to 
do so.  
 If CBG  is less th an 6mmol/L take a sweet  or 150ml of a clear  sugary drink  
 They should inform  staff at the Same Day Admission that they have done this  because  
their surgery time may have to be delayed .

Title:  
Guidelines on Pre- Operative Fasting for Elective 
Surgery  
 Document No:

Date Revised:  16 December  2019 
Version Number:  6 Approved By:  
Chairman, Medical Board 
 
 
1. POLICY 
 
1.1 This policy establishes the Hospital’s guidelines on pre- operative fasting for elective 
surgery.  
1.2 These Guidelines may not apply to, or may need to be modified for patients with co-
existing diseases or conditions that can affect gastric emptying or  fluid volume (e.g.  
diabetes , pregnancy, hiatal hernia, ileus or bowel obstruction, emergency care, enteral 
tube feeding) and patients in whom airway management  might be difficult. The 
anesthesia providers should recognize that these conditions can increas e the likelihood 
of regurgitation with pulmonary aspiration and additional or alternate preventive 
strategies may be appropriate for such patients and should be communicated to the 
clinical care team.  
 
 
2. PURPOSE 
 
2.1 The aim of pre- operative fasting is to minim ise the volume of stomach contents and its 
acidity. Regurgitation of stomach contents and its subsequent aspiration is an inherent 
risk during general anaesthesia, regional anaesthesia and sedation.  
2.2 Excessive fasting is unpleasant for patients and should be avoided. It may cause dehydration, electrolyte abnormalities, hypoglycaemia (particularly in children), insulin resistance, headaches, confusion, irritability, anxiety , nausea and vomiting.  
2.3 The guideline aims to enhance the quality and efficiency of anes thesia care via 
increased patient satisfaction,  avoidance of delays and cancellations, decreased risk of 
dehydration or hypoglycemia from prolonged fasting, and the minimization of 
perioperative morbidity.  
2.4 The guidelines do not apply to patients who undergo procedures with no anesthesia or 
only local anesthesia when upper airway protective reflexes are not impaired and no risk 
factors for pulmonary aspiration are apparent.  
   
3. STANDARD  
 
3.1 This guideline incorporates data published since Version 1 of the guidel ine in 2009.  
 
 
4. DEFINITIONS 
 
4.1 Fasting:  A prescribed period of time before a procedure when patients are not allowed 
the oral intake of fluids or solids  
4.2 Clear  fluids : Examples of clear fluids  include, but are not limited to, water, fruit juices 
without pulp,  carbonated drinks, clear tea/black coffee without milk products. No alcohol 
or energy drinks.  
4.3 Light breakfast: A toast with jam or 2 pieces of biscuits with a cup of clear fluids .
 No high 
fibre cereals such as muesli, bran etc and no fried/oily foods .

Given your medical history, it's important to inform the anesthesia team about any concerns or questions you may have regarding the anesthesia.

Please follow these instructions closely to ensure a safe and successful surgery.","### Instructions for Medical Colleagues:

**1. Should the patient be seen by a Doctor or a Nurse?**
   - Nurse

**2. Fasting instructions:**
   - No solid food from 12 midnight.
   - Allow clear fluids up to 2 hours before the procedure.

**3. Suitability for preoperative carbohydrate loading:**
   - No

**4. Medication instructions:**
   - NA (The patient is not on any chronic medications)

**5. Instructions for the healthcare team:**
   - NA

**6. Preoperative optimization required for the patient:**
   - NA

**7. Any need to delay the operation for further medical workup and preoperative optimization?**
   - No

**8. Any specific department protocols to follow for this patient:**
   - Guidelines on Pre-Operative Fasting for Elective Surgery should be followed to minimize the risk of aspiration and ensure the patient is well-prepared for anesthesia.

### Instructions for the Patient:

**1. Medication Instructions Leading Up to the Surgery:**
   - You don’t have any regular medications to take. On the day of your surgery, follow the fasting instructions carefully.

**2. Consent for Types of Anesthesia and Risks:**
   - You will likely receive anesthesia that makes you sleep and not feel pain during the surgery. The anesthesia team will discuss the exact type of anesthesia with you on the day of surgery. There are always small risks with anesthesia, like allergic reactions, breathing problems, or other side effects, but these are very rare. Since you're a social smoker and drinker, it's important that you avoid alcohol leading up to your surgery and consider quitting smoking. Smoking can slow down the healing process and increase the risk of complications after surgery. If you have any concerns or questions, feel free to ask the anesthesia team before your surgery.

### Notes for Completion:
- Ensure the patient and her family understand the fasting instructions.
- Reinforce the importance of not smoking or drinking before the procedure.

• Hypokalemia  hyperaldosteronism  
• Look through available CT abdomen for adrenal masses  
 Refer young hypertensive patients and patients with signs of secondary hypertension to 
IMPT for work up prior to surgery  (discuss with surgeon regarding benefit of 
postponing operation for further work up vs risk of delaying surgery)  
 Low threshold for referral to IMPT for young hypertensives  
 If no suspicion of secondary hypertension, manage as for pre -existing hypertension  
 
PERIOPERATIVE OPTIMIZATION OF MEDICATIONS  
 Continue all anti-hypertensives on the day of operation except ACEi/ARB (refer to below)   
 Take with sip of water at 6am on day of surgery 
 Beta-blockers  
 Patients with ≥ 3 revised cardiac risk index ( RCRI)  factors or intermediate/high cardiac 
risk on preoperative tests, it may be reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery – 
discuss with cardiologist or PEC consultant if it should be started  
 Beta blockers should not be initiated within 24h of surgery 
 Diuretics  
 Watch out for hypokalemia and evaluate patient’s volume status on the day of operation  
 Angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/ Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs)  
 ACEi can cause refractory post induction hypotension if not stopped preoperatively  
 In non-cardiac surgery, consider discontinuation 24 hours preoperatively and restart within 48 hours after operation in patients with well controlled hypertension unless 
clinically contraindicated  
 Continue ACEi preoperatively  if there is impaired LV systolic function or heart

 New symptoms suggestive of angina or congestive heart failure  
 New onset murmur  
 Change in baseline effort tolerance without apparent cause  
 Abnormal investigations (not previously known or investigated)  
 Changes in ECG suggestive of ischemia or previous infarct  
 Changes in rhythm  
o Left bundle branch block  
o Right bu ndle branch bloc k in symptomatic patients or asymptomatic 
above 50 years old  
o Atrial fibrillation  
o Premature ventricular contractions causing symptoms or in patients 
with underlying structural heart disease, coronary artery disease or low 
ejection fraction  
 
b. Coronary revascularization before non -cardiac surgery  
 Revascularisation before non -cardiac surgery is recommended when indicated by existing 
Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs)  – discuss with cardiologist/PEC consultant if patient 
has previously refused PCI and has persistent symptoms of angina or heart failure  
 Coronary revascularisation is not recommended before non -cardiac surgery exclusively to 
reduce perioperative cardiac ev ents. 
 
c. Valvular heart disease  
 For adults who meet standard indications for valvular intervention (replacement and repair) on 
the basis of symptoms and severity of stenosis or regurgitation, valvular intervention before 
elective non -cardiac surgery is effec tive in reducing perioperative risk.  
 Discuss with PEC consultant if patient  
o Has symptoms of valvular disease  
o Has newly diagnosed severe valvular disease  
o Change from known mild -moderate disease to severe valvular disease that 
has not been investigated  
 
6. MANAGEMENT OF PHARMACOTHERAPY  
 
a. Beta-blockers  
 Beta -blockers should be continued in patients who are already receiving them  
 Patients with ≥ 3 RCRI factors or intermediate/high risk preoperative tests, it may be 
reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery  – discuss with cardiologist or PEC 
consultant if it should be started  
 Beta blockers should not be initiated  within 24h  of surgery

1. PURPOSE  
 To promote individualized assessment and counselling of perioperative cardiac risks for  
patients  listed  for non -cardiac surgery  
 To provide guidelines for referrals and investigations for patients with cardiac conditions going 
for both elective and  emergency surgery  
 To guide pharmacological management of patients on medications for their cardiac conditions  
2. STANDARD  
 Recommendations are based on current best evidence summarized in the references below, 
with consideration of the prevailing practices in  this institution.  
 Management decisions should be based on the individual patient and in consultation with the 
attending surgeon, anesthetist and cardiologist.  
 
3. PERIOPERATIVE CARDIAC ASSESSMENT (ACC/AHA 2014)  
 
Many patients undergoing major non -cardiac surgery are at risk for a cardiovascular event. The 
risk is related to both patient - and surgery - specific characteristics. Identification of any increased 
risk provides the patient, surgeon and anaesthetist with information to formulate risk-benefit ratio 
of the procedure. The surgeon provides surgery -specific risks, and the anesthetists  counsel s for both 
patient - and anaesthesia - specific risks, which can be very different from surgical risks.  
 
Procedure risk str atification  
 
 Life or limb -threatening emergencies  when  there is time for no or limited clinical 
evaluation, typically within 6h : 
i. Proceed, institute measures to maintain coronary perfusion and cardiac 
output  
ii. Refer to CVM for postoperative evaluation and management  
 
 Elective surgery  
i. To consider time frame available for preoperative optimization  
 Time -sensitive procedure: one in which a delay of > 1h to 6 weeks to allow 
for an evaluation and significant changes in management will negatively 
affect outcome  (e.g. malignancy, critical limb ischemia, carotid 
endarterectomy, infections)  
 Elective procedure: procedure could be delayed for up to 1 year

The patient should fast for at least 6 hours before the scheduled time of the operation. This means that the patient should not eat or drink anything except water after midnight the night before the operation.

Suitability for preoperative carbohydrate loading (Yes or No):
Based on the patient's medical history and the results of the investigations, I do not recommend preoperative carbohydrate loading for this patient.

Medication instructions - name each medication and give the instructions for the day of the operation and days leading up to the operation as required:
a. Perindopril: Continue taking this medication as prescribed until the day of the operation.
b. Omeprazole: Continue taking this medication as prescribed until the day of the operation.
c. Bisoprolol: Continue taking this medication as prescribed until the day of the operation.
d. Atorvastatin: Continue taking this medication as prescribed until the day of the operation.
e. Aspirin: Stop taking this medication 7-10 days before the operation.
f. Amlodipine: Continue taking this medication as prescribed until the day of the operation.

Any instructions for the healthcare team - for example, preoperative blood group matching, arranging for preoperative dialysis, or standby post-operative high dependency/ICU beds:
Based on the patient's medical history and the results of the investigations, I recommend that the healthcare team arrange for preoperative dialysis and have a standby post-operative high dependency/ICU bed available, in case of any complications during or after the operation.

Any preoperative optimization required for the patient - list what needs to be optimized:
Based on the patient's medical history and the results of the investigations, I recommend that the patient's hyperlipidemia and hypertension be optimized before the operation. This can be achieved by adjusting the patient's medications and ensuring that the patient follows a healthy diet and lifestyle.

Any need to delay the operation for further medical workup and preoperative optimization:
Based on the patient's medical history and the results of the investigations, I do not recommend delaying the operation for further medical workup or preoperative optimization. The patient is ready for the scheduled operation.

Any specific department protocols to follow for this patient - name as many as necessary, and give short reasoning for using these protocols:
Based on the patient's medical history and the results of the investigations, I recommend that the following department protocols be followed for this patient:
a. Anticoagulation protocol: The patient should be placed on a low-molecular-weight heparin protocol to prevent venous thromboembolism (VTE) during the operation.
b. Infection control protocol: The patient should be treated with prophy",,,

• Hypokalemia  hyperaldosteronism  
• Look through available CT abdomen for adrenal masses  
 Refer young hypertensive patients and patients with signs of secondary hypertension to 
IMPT for work up prior to surgery  (discuss with surgeon regarding benefit of 
postponing operation for further work up vs risk of delaying surgery)  
 Low threshold for referral to IMPT for young hypertensives  
 If no suspicion of secondary hypertension, manage as for pre -existing hypertension  
 
PERIOPERATIVE OPTIMIZATION OF MEDICATIONS  
 Continue all anti-hypertensives on the day of operation except ACEi/ARB (refer to below)   
 Take with sip of water at 6am on day of surgery 
 Beta-blockers  
 Patients with ≥ 3 revised cardiac risk index ( RCRI)  factors or intermediate/high cardiac 
risk on preoperative tests, it may be reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery – 
discuss with cardiologist or PEC consultant if it should be started  
 Beta blockers should not be initiated within 24h of surgery 
 Diuretics  
 Watch out for hypokalemia and evaluate patient’s volume status on the day of operation  
 Angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/ Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs)  
 ACEi can cause refractory post induction hypotension if not stopped preoperatively  
 In non-cardiac surgery, consider discontinuation 24 hours preoperatively and restart within 48 hours after operation in patients with well controlled hypertension unless 
clinically contraindicated  
 Continue ACEi preoperatively  if there is impaired LV systolic function or heart 
failure or if BP is poorly controlled

 New symptoms suggestive of angina or congestive heart failure  
 New onset murmur  
 Change in baseline effort tolerance without apparent cause  
 Abnormal investigations (not previously known or investigated)  
 Changes in ECG suggestive of ischemia or previous infarct  
 Changes in rhythm  
o Left bundle branch block  
o Right bu ndle branch bloc k in symptomatic patients or asymptomatic 
above 50 years old  
o Atrial fibrillation  
o Premature ventricular contractions causing symptoms or in patients 
with underlying structural heart disease, coronary artery disease or low 
ejection fraction  
 
b. Coronary revascularization before non -cardiac surgery  
 Revascularisation before non -cardiac surgery is recommended when indicated by existing 
Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs)  – discuss with cardiologist/PEC consultant if patient 
has previously refused PCI and has persistent symptoms of angina or heart failure  
 Coronary revascularisation is not recommended before non -cardiac surgery exclusively to 
reduce perioperative cardiac ev ents. 
 
c. Valvular heart disease  
 For adults who meet standard indications for valvular intervention (replacement and repair) on 
the basis of symptoms and severity of stenosis or regurgitation, valvular intervention before 
elective non -cardiac surgery is effec tive in reducing perioperative risk.  
 Discuss with PEC consultant if patient  
o Has symptoms of valvular disease  
o Has newly diagnosed severe valvular disease  
o Change from known mild -moderate disease to severe valvular disease that 
has not been investigated  
 
6. MANAGEMENT OF PHARMACOTHERAPY  
 
a. Beta-blockers  
 Beta -blockers should be continued in patients who are already receiving them  
 Patients with ≥ 3 RCRI factors or intermediate/high risk preoperative tests, it may be 
reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery  – discuss with cardiologist or PEC 
consultant if it should be started  
 Beta blockers should not be initiated  within 24h  of surgery

Optimization of M edical Comorbidities  
a. Anemia  
i. Screening for iron- deficiency will be performed. If 
present, to prescribe either oral or IV iron according 
to protocol.  
o Frailty  
o Patients who screen positive for physical frailty 
(EFS >=6) or functional limitation (EFS functional 
score >=2) will be referred for the preoperative 
prehabilitation program (PREPARE)  
o Smoking cessation  
o All existing smokers will be advised to reduce / abstain 
for smoking until surgery. 
o Preoperative carbohydrate loading  
o Pre-operative carbohydrate drink will be prescribed to be 
taken on evening before surgery and 2 hours before 
surgery if there are no contraindications (BMI >35, reflux, 
diabetes mellitus)  
o If mechanical bowel preparation is required for the 
surgery, patients  are encouraged to maintain intake of 
clear fluids up to 2 hours before surgery.  
Intraoperative Management  
Volume management  Aim euvolemia  
• Consider goal-directed fluid therapy with a minimally invasive 
cardiac output monitor for high risk patients or patients undergoing 
high-risk procedures (large intravascular fluid shifts / blood loss)  
• Eg. IA line monitoring with pulse pressure variation (PPV) trending 
or Flotrach  
Pain Management  Aim for multimodal, opioid -sparing analgesia to decrease opioid -related 
adverse effects (e.g. nausea, vomiting, sedation, ileus and respiratory 
depression) and to expedite recovery after surgery .

Pre-Operative  
1) Nurse  
- Conduct preoperative education  on post operative recovery goals  such as breathing exercises, early 
ambulation , pain control, early eating and drinking , early removal of IV lines  and drains  and discharge .  
- Baseline EQ5D  
- Ensure that ERAS patient is labelled as such in OT listing under ‘ remarks’ and ‘name of operation’  
2) Anaesthesia evaluation  
- Pre-operative carbohydrate drink to be taken the evening before surgery and 2 hours before surgery if no 
contraindications  (obesity, reflux, di abetes mellitus)  
- Malnutrition screening with MUST (Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool).  
o If patients score >=2 , and there is at least 7 days to surgery , and no preoperative enteral nutrition 
has been ordered by the surgeon , to raise referral to dietitian in PEC for preoperative nutritional 
optimization.  
Intra -Operative  
Before Induction  
- On day before surgery or at team brief with surgeon, discuss regarding  
o central venous catheter (CVC) – if needed for hemodynamic management  
o indwelling catheter (IDC) – if needed for intraoperative and postoperative volume management  
o OGT/NGT – if inserted, whether it can be removed at the end of surgery  
o Postoperative analgesia  
 For open liver surgeries, preperitoneal wound infiltration with LA or insert a wound ca theter 
for LA infiltration (Bbraun OnQ PainBuster), in addition to PCA morphine , is preferred over 
thoracic epidural.  
 For lap liver surgeries, discuss if PCA morphine will be required  
Intraoperative  
1) Volume Management  
 During liver resection, aim for judi cious fluid therapy  
o Maintainence fluid 1 -4ml/kg/h  
o If CVP is high and/or the liver is congested, any of the following can be considered:  
 GTN infusion (starting rates at 0.5mg/h)  
 Increase forward flow of the heart (heart rate/contractility)  
 Diuretics  
 Improve ventilatory mechanics (No/low PEEP, longer I:E ratio, low peak airway pressures, 
mode)  
 Aim to restore normovolemia after the resection phase.

• Hypokalemia  hyperaldosteronism  
• Look through available CT abdomen for adrenal masses  
 Refer young hypertensive patients and patients with signs of secondary hypertension to 
IMPT for work up prior to surgery  (discuss with surgeon regarding benefit of 
postponing operation for further work up vs risk of delaying surgery)  
 Low threshold for referral to IMPT for young hypertensives  
 If no suspicion of secondary hypertension, manage as for pre -existing hypertension  
 
PERIOPERATIVE OPTIMIZATION OF MEDICATIONS  
 Continue all anti-hypertensives on the day of operation except ACEi/ARB (refer to below)   
 Take with sip of water at 6am on day of surgery 
 Beta-blockers  
 Patients with ≥ 3 revised cardiac risk index ( RCRI)  factors or intermediate/high cardiac 
risk on preoperative tests, it may be reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery – 
discuss with cardiologist or PEC consultant if it should be started  
 Beta blockers should not be initiated within 24h of surgery 
 Diuretics  
 Watch out for hypokalemia and evaluate patient’s volume status on the day of operation  
 Angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/ Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs)  
 ACEi can cause refractory post induction hypotension if not stopped preoperatively  
 In non-cardiac surgery, consider discontinuation 24 hours preoperatively and restart within 48 hours after operation in patients with well controlled hypertension unless 
clinically contraindicated  
 Continue ACEi preoperatively  if there is impaired LV systolic function or heart 
failure or if BP is poorly controlled

• IV paracetamol 1 g - If no liver impairment or child’s A liver cirrhosis. 
Consider 500mg in Child’s B/C cirrhosis  
• IV parecoxib 40mg - Avoid in patients with creatinine clearance 
<30ml/min, Child’s B/C cirrhosis, history of peptic ulcer disease, 
decompensated heart failure or ischemic heart disease  
• Lignocaine infusion (Loading dose of 1-1.5mg/kg followed by 1-1.5 
mg/kg/hr infusion intraoperatively).  
o Consider early discontinuation intraoperatively eg. after 
completion of colon resection, if a wound catheter wil l be 
inserted or LA infiltration will be performed. Otherwise, stop when surgery is done.  
o Dose reduction should be done in liver 
impairment/congestive heart failure  
 
• Can also consider p recedex infusion  or ketamine bolus / infusion  
 
Regional techniques  
• Insertion of wound catheter at preperitoneal space (BBraun OnQ 
PainBuster)  
o Infiltration of the preperitoneal space and subcutaneous 
layer with 20ml of ropivacaine 0.2% should be done before 
commencing LA infusion through the wound catheter. 1-3  
• Bilateral TAP block (for incision below umbilicus), or bilateral rectus 
sheath block (for incision above umbilicus) by anaesthetist or 
surgeon  
• Thoracic epidural analgesia (T7-T10) (TEA)

• For lap surgeries, discuss with surgeon if PCA morphine is required 
• For open surgeries, either   
o PCA morphine +/- wound catheter infiltration  
o TEA 
Anaesthesia regimen • Cerebral function monitoring – to avoid overdose of anaesthesia 
especially in the elderly, to reduce risk of postoperative delirium and 
postoperative cognitive dysfunction.  Aim BIS 40 -60 or PSI 25-50.

o If patients sc ore >=2, and, to raise referral to dietitian in PEC for 
preoperative nutritional optimization.  
3. Minimization of fasting  
o Pre-operative carbohydrate drink to be taken the evening before 
surgery and 2 hours before surgery if no contraindications (obesity, reflux, diabetes mellitus)  
o Rationale: preoperative carbohydrate treatment is associated with reduced post -operative insulin resistance, enhanced return of bowel 
function, and shorter hospital stay with no effect on post -operative 
complication rates. Insufficient studies on its use in obese / diabetic patients.  
4. Optimization of medical comorbidities  
o Iron-deficiency anemia . If present, and anemia is moderate in nature 
(Hb <=11 g/dL), to refer to IMPT (internal medicine perioperative team) 
for suitability of IV iro n treatment . To discuss with surgeon to consider 
delaying surgery for 2-4 weeks for haemoglobin response to treatment.  
o Menorrhagia with severe anemia . If present to discuss with surgeons if 
patient may be suitable for GnRH agonists in conjunction with 
hema tinics and to consider delay ing surgery for 2-4 weeks  for 
haemoglobin response to treatment to minimize blood transfusion  
o Other medical comorbidities . If present, to be referred to either IMPT 
or other appropriate medical disciplines

Any need to delay the operation for further medical workup and preoperative optimization? - Yes, the operation should be delayed until the patient's hypertension and hyperlipidemia are optimized, and their creatinine level is stable.
Any specific department protocols to follow for this patient -
a. The patient should be admitted to the hospital on the day of the surgery, and the anesthesia team should be notified of the patient's arrival.
b. The patient should be positioned in a way that allows easy access to the wound site during the operation.
c. The patient's allergy to non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be taken into consideration when planning the anesthesia.
In lay language, the patient needs to take their regular medications as usual on the day of the surgery, but they should not eat anything after midnight the night before the surgery. They should also inform the healthcare team if they experience any worsening of symptoms or if they have any concerns. The patient's hypertension and hyperlipidemia need to be optimized before the surgery, and their creatinine level needs to be monitored closely during the operation. The patient should be positioned in a way that allows easy access to the wound site during the surgery. Finally, the patient's allergy to NSAIDs should be taken into consideration when planning the anesthesia.","Based on the clinical summary provided, here are the preoperative anesthesia instructions for the patient:

Should the patient be seen by a Doctor or a Nurse?
Answer: The patient should be seen by a Doctor (Anesthesiologist) for preoperative evaluation and planning.
Fasting instructions - list instructions based on the number of hours before the listed surgery:
Answer: The patient should fast for at least 6 hours before the scheduled surgery time. Water and medications are allowed, but no solid food or non-clear liquids should be consumed during this time.
Suitability for preoperative carbohydrate loading (Yes or No):
Answer: No, the patient is not a suitable candidate for preoperative carbohydrate loading due to their history of hyperlipidemia and hypertension.
Medication instructions - name each medication and give the instructions for the day of the operation and days leading up to the operation as required:
Answer: The patient should continue taking their chronic medications as prescribed, including Losartan, Pravastatin, Omeprazole, and Pregabalin. On the day of the operation, the patient should take their medications with a sip of water only.
Any instructions for the healthcare team - for example, preoperative blood group matching, arranging for preoperative dialysis, or standby post-operative high dependency/ICU beds:
Answer: The healthcare team should be aware of the patient's allergies and medical history, including their history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and peptic ulcer disease. Preoperative blood group matching and preoperative dialysis may be necessary based on the patient's renal function and the planned surgical procedure. Standby post-operative high dependency/ICU beds should be arranged in case of any complications.
Any preoperative optimization required for the patient - list what needs to be optimized:
Answer: The patient's preoperative optimization should include close monitoring of their blood pressure and electrolytes, as well as optimization of their chronic medications to minimize the risk of perioperative complications.
Any need to delay the operation for further medical workup and preoperative optimization?
Answer: Yes, the patient's surgery should be delayed until their renal function and electrolytes are stable, and their chronic medications are optimized.
Any specific department protocols to follow for this patient - name as many as necessary, and give short reasoning for using these protocols:
Answer: The patient should be managed according to the department's protocol for high-risk surgical patients, including close monitoring of their vital signs and electrolytes, and regular assessment of their renal function. Additionally, the patient's medications should be carefully managed to minimize the risk of perioperative complications.
Lay language instructions for the patient:
Medication instructions to take leading up to the surgery: The patient should continue taking their chronic medications as prescribed, including Losartan, Pravastatin, Omeprazole, and Pregabalin. On the day of the operation, the patient should take their medications with a sip of water only.

• Hypokalemia  hyperaldosteronism  
• Look through available CT abdomen for adrenal masses  
 Refer young hypertensive patients and patients with signs of secondary hypertension to 
IMPT for work up prior to surgery  (discuss with surgeon regarding benefit of 
postponing operation for further work up vs risk of delaying surgery)  
 Low threshold for referral to IMPT for young hypertensives  
 If no suspicion of secondary hypertension, manage as for pre -existing hypertension  
 
PERIOPERATIVE OPTIMIZATION OF MEDICATIONS  
 Continue all anti-hypertensives on the day of operation except ACEi/ARB (refer to below)   
 Take with sip of water at 6am on day of surgery 
 Beta-blockers  
 Patients with ≥ 3 revised cardiac risk index ( RCRI)  factors or intermediate/high cardiac 
risk on preoperative tests, it may be reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery – 
discuss with cardiologist or PEC consultant if it should be started  
 Beta blockers should not be initiated within 24h of surgery 
 Diuretics  
 Watch out for hypokalemia and evaluate patient’s volume status on the day of operation  
 Angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/ Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs)  
 ACEi can cause refractory post induction hypotension if not stopped preoperatively  
 In non-cardiac surgery, consider discontinuation 24 hours preoperatively and restart within 48 hours after operation in patients with well controlled hypertension unless 
clinically contraindicated  
 Continue ACEi preoperatively  if there is impaired LV systolic function or heart 
failure or if BP is poorly controlled

• Look through available CT abdomen for adrenal masses  
 Refer young hypertensive patients and patients with signs of secondary hypertension to 
IMPT for work up prior to surgery  (discuss with surgeon regarding benefit of 
postponing operation for further work up vs risk of delaying surgery)  
 Low threshold for referral to IMPT for young hypertensives

PERIOPERATIVE OPTIMIZATION OF MEDICATIONS  
 Continue all anti-hypertensives on the day of operation except ACEi/ARB (refer to below)   
 Take with sip of water at 6am on day of surgery 
 Beta-blockers  
 Patients with ≥ 3 revised cardiac risk index ( RCRI)  factors or intermediate/high cardiac 
risk on preoperative tests, it may be reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery – 
discuss with cardiologist or PEC consultant if it should be started  
 Beta blockers should not be initiated within 24h of surgery 
 Diuretics  
 Watch out for hypokalemia and evaluate patient’s volume status on the day of operation  
 Angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/ Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs)  
 ACEi can cause refractory post induction hypotension if not stopped preoperatively  
 In non-cardiac surgery, consider discontinuation 24 hours preoperatively and restart within 48 hours after operation in patients with well controlled hypertension unless 
clinically contraindicated  
 Continue ACEi preoperatively  if there is impaired LV systolic function or heart 
failure or if BP is poorly controlled

Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs)  – discuss with cardiologist/PEC consultant if patient 
has previously refused PCI and has persistent symptoms of angina or heart failure  
 Coronary revascularisation is not recommended before non -cardiac surgery exclusively to 
reduce perioperative cardiac ev ents. 
 
c. Valvular heart disease  
 For adults who meet standard indications for valvular intervention (replacement and repair) on 
the basis of symptoms and severity of stenosis or regurgitation, valvular intervention before 
elective non -cardiac surgery is effec tive in reducing perioperative risk.  
 Discuss with PEC consultant if patient  
o Has symptoms of valvular disease  
o Has newly diagnosed severe valvular disease  
o Change from known mild -moderate disease to severe valvular disease that 
has not been investigated  
 
6. MANAGEMENT OF PHARMACOTHERAPY  
 
a. Beta-blockers  
 Beta -blockers should be continued in patients who are already receiving them  
 Patients with ≥ 3 RCRI factors or intermediate/high risk preoperative tests, it may be 
reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery  – discuss with cardiologist or PEC 
consultant if it should be started  
 Beta blockers should not be initiated  within 24h  of surgery

1. PURPOSE  
 To promote individualized assessment and counselling of perioperative cardiac risks for  
patients  listed  for non -cardiac surgery  
 To provide guidelines for referrals and investigations for patients with cardiac conditions going 
for both elective and  emergency surgery  
 To guide pharmacological management of patients on medications for their cardiac conditions  
2. STANDARD  
 Recommendations are based on current best evidence summarized in the references below, 
with consideration of the prevailing practices in  this institution.  
 Management decisions should be based on the individual patient and in consultation with the 
attending surgeon, anesthetist and cardiologist.  
 
3. PERIOPERATIVE CARDIAC ASSESSMENT (ACC/AHA 2014)  
 
Many patients undergoing major non -cardiac surgery are at risk for a cardiovascular event. The 
risk is related to both patient - and surgery - specific characteristics. Identification of any increased 
risk provides the patient, surgeon and anaesthetist with information to formulate risk-benefit ratio 
of the procedure. The surgeon provides surgery -specific risks, and the anesthetists  counsel s for both 
patient - and anaesthesia - specific risks, which can be very different from surgical risks.  
 
Procedure risk str atification  
 
 Life or limb -threatening emergencies  when  there is time for no or limited clinical 
evaluation, typically within 6h : 
i. Proceed, institute measures to maintain coronary perfusion and cardiac 
output  
ii. Refer to CVM for postoperative evaluation and management  
 
 Elective surgery  
i. To consider time frame available for preoperative optimization  
 Time -sensitive procedure: one in which a delay of > 1h to 6 weeks to allow 
for an evaluation and significant changes in management will negatively 
affect outcome  (e.g. malignancy, critical limb ischemia, carotid 
endarterectomy, infections)  
 Elective procedure: procedure could be delayed for up to 1 year

• Hypokalemia  hyperaldosteronism  
• Look through available CT abdomen for adrenal masses  
 Refer young hypertensive patients and patients with signs of secondary hypertension to 
IMPT for work up prior to surgery  (discuss with surgeon regarding benefit of 
postponing operation for further work up vs risk of delaying surgery)  
 Low threshold for referral to IMPT for young hypertensives  
 If no suspicion of secondary hypertension, manage as for pre -existing hypertension  
 
PERIOPERATIVE OPTIMIZATION OF MEDICATIONS  
 Continue all anti-hypertensives on the day of operation except ACEi/ARB (refer to below)   
 Take with sip of water at 6am on day of surgery 
 Beta-blockers  
 Patients with ≥ 3 revised cardiac risk index ( RCRI)  factors or intermediate/high cardiac 
risk on preoperative tests, it may be reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery – 
discuss with cardiologist or PEC consultant if it should be started  
 Beta blockers should not be initiated within 24h of surgery 
 Diuretics  
 Watch out for hypokalemia and evaluate patient’s volume status on the day of operation  
 Angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/ Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs)  
 ACEi can cause refractory post induction hypotension if not stopped preoperatively  
 In non-cardiac surgery, consider discontinuation 24 hours preoperatively and restart within 48 hours after operation in patients with well controlled hypertension unless 
clinically contraindicated  
 Continue ACEi preoperatively  if there is impaired LV systolic function or heart 
failure or if BP is poorly controlled

1. BACKGROUND  
a. Obesity is a relatively common condition, that can have a profound impact on 
morbidity/mortality and anesthesia. Careful attention should be given to airway anatomy 
and the potential physiological derangements.  
b. Communication: non -pejorative, while not avoiding important risks and issues, aiming to 
avoid distress and allow bette r communication with patient and relatives.  
2. ASSESSMENT  
FOR BODY MASS INDEX >35  
i. HISTORY  
1. Cardio status – Hypertension, Ischaemic Heart Disease, Effort tolerance, Symptoms of 
heart failure, deep vein thrombosis  
2. Respiratory status – Screen for  Obstructive Sleep Apnea using STOPBang tool (if high risk 
for moderate -severe OSA , refer OSA protocol ),  Asthma  
3. Gastro -esophageal reflux, Diabetes Mellitus  
4. Airway – Review old records for history of difficult intubations  
ii. EXAMINATION  
1. Airwa y – Mouth opening, Mallampati, Neck extension and circumference  
2. Dentition – loose, crowns and bridges  
iii. INVESTIGATIONS  
1. Bloods – FBC/UE,  CREAT,  GLU  
2. ECG – specifically looking for – LV hypertrophy or strain, RBBB or Rt axis deviation, P -
pulmo nale  
3. CXR – specifically looking for – cardiomegaly, evidence of heart failure

     - Salbutamol (salbutamol PRN): Do not use on the day of surgery.

5. **Instructions for the Healthcare Team**:
   - Preoperative blood group matching if not already done.
   - Consider standby post-operative high dependency/ICU bed based on the patient's history of obstructive sleep apnea.

6. **Preoperative Optimization Required**:
   - Compliance with CPAP therapy for obstructive sleep apnea should be optimized if possible.
   - Ensure asthma management is stable and optimized before surgery.

7. **Need to Delay the Operation for Further Medical Workup and Preoperative Optimization?**: No

8. **Specific Department Protocols**:
   - Follow the ASA Stratification for preoperative assessment.
   - Consider the patient's history of obstructive sleep apnea when planning anesthesia and postoperative monitoring.

Instructions for the Patient:
1. Medication Instructions:
   - Take all your medications as usual except for Seratide (Seretide) on the day of surgery. Take Seretide with a sip of water at 6 AM.
   - Do not use Salbutamol (salbutamol PRN) on the day of surgery.

2. Consent for Anesthesia:
   - You will be receiving anesthesia for your surgery. Anesthesia will be administered by the anesthesia team, and they will ensure your comfort and safety throughout the procedure.
   - Due to your history of obstructive sleep apnea, special precautions will be taken to monitor your breathing and oxygen levels during surgery and in the recovery period.
   - Please inform the anesthesia team if you have any concerns or questions about anesthesia.

Please note that these instructions are based on the provided information and department guidelines. The patient should follow these instructions as directed to ensure a safe and successful surgery.","### Preoperative Anesthesia Instructions:

1. **Doctor or Nurse**: Doctor
2. **Fasting Instructions**: NPO for solids for 8 hours, clear liquids allowed up to 2 hours before surgery.
3. **Carbohydrate Loading Suitability**: No (due to impaired glucose tolerance).
4. **Medication Instructions**:
   - Losartan: Hold on the day of surgery.
   - Fenofibrate: Continue as prescribed.
   - Neurobion: Continue as prescribed.
   - Seretide: Continue regular doses, use salbutamol as needed for asthma symptoms.
5. **Healthcare Team Instructions**: NA.
6. **Preoperative Optimization**: The patient should use CPAP consistently for his obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) leading up to the surgery, even though he has been non-compliant in the past.
7. **Delay Operation for Optimization?**: NA.
8. **Specific Department Protocols**: 
   - Follow the “Guidelines on Preoperative Assessment of Obese Patients” since the patient has a BMI of 33.7. It is crucial to assess the risks associated with obesity, such as difficult airway management and postoperative ventilation.
   - “Preoperative investigation guidelines for patients presenting for elective surgery” should be adhered to for comprehensive assessment and management given the patient’s ASA status and age.

### Instructions for Patient in Lay Language:

1. **Medication Instructions**:
   - You should not take Losartan on the morning of your surgery. Please continue to take all your other medications, like Fenofibrate, Neurobion, and Seretide, as you normally do. If you experience any difficulty breathing or asthma symptoms, you may use your salbutamol as needed.
   - It is important to use your CPAP machine every night until your surgery, even if you haven't been using it regularly.

2. **Anesthesia Consent Information**:
   - You will likely receive general anesthesia for your surgery, which means you will be asleep and will not feel anything during the procedure. Because of your medical history, including obesity and sleep apnea, there are some increased risks associated with anesthesia, like difficulty breathing and managing your airway. However, our team is well-equipped and experienced in managing these issues. It's important to discuss and understand these risks, and feel free to ask any questions you may have during the consent process.","Based on the information provided, I have evaluated the patient's clinical summary and provide the following preoperative anesthesia instructions for the patient:

• Hypokalemia  hyperaldosteronism  
• Look through available CT abdomen for adrenal masses  
 Refer young hypertensive patients and patients with signs of secondary hypertension to 
IMPT for work up prior to surgery  (discuss with surgeon regarding benefit of 
postponing operation for further work up vs risk of delaying surgery)  
 Low threshold for referral to IMPT for young hypertensives  
 If no suspicion of secondary hypertension, manage as for pre -existing hypertension  
 
PERIOPERATIVE OPTIMIZATION OF MEDICATIONS  
 Continue all anti-hypertensives on the day of operation except ACEi/ARB (refer to below)   
 Take with sip of water at 6am on day of surgery 
 Beta-blockers  
 Patients with ≥ 3 revised cardiac risk index ( RCRI)  factors or intermediate/high cardiac 
risk on preoperative tests, it may be reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery – 
discuss with cardiologist or PEC consultant if it should be started  
 Beta blockers should not be initiated within 24h of surgery 
 Diuretics  
 Watch out for hypokalemia and evaluate patient’s volume status on the day of operation  
 Angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/ Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs)  
 ACEi can cause refractory post induction hypotension if not stopped preoperatively  
 In non-cardiac surgery, consider discontinuation 24 hours preoperatively and restart within 48 hours after operation in patients with well controlled hypertension unless 
clinically contraindicated  
 Continue ACEi preoperatively  if there is impaired LV systolic function or heart 
failure or if BP is poorly controlled

 c. Optimization strategies  
 
 
6. SMOKING CESSATION  
 
a. All smokers should be  actively encouraged to quit smoking regardless of time frame prior 
to surgery  as cessation even on the day before surgery is beneficial.  
 
b. All patients are screened for smoking history  during nursing assessmen t, and active 
smokers are offered enrolment int o the preoperative smoking cessation counselling 
sessions by PEC nurses .  
▪ These sessions will educate  the patient  on smoking related postoperative 
complications and benefits of perioperative smoking cessation . 
▪ Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) may  be offered if patients are keen and 
there are no contraindications. After the counselling session, PEC nurse will issue 
the recommended intervention and MO will help to  order the prescription for 
NRT. MO to refer to Annex for ‘NRT Prescription Table for use in PAC’.  
▪ HPB quit for life brochure and hospital support hotline will be given by PEC nurse.  
 
c. Patients who decline the preoperative smoking cessation counselling by PEC nurses can 
still be referred t o SGH smoking cessation clinic if they are  keen.  
 
7. RISK COUNSELLING  
 
a. For patients with risk factors for postoperative pulmonary complications (refer to Section 
3a), counsel patient for increased risks of:  
i. Pneumonia, respiratory failure, prolonged mechanical ventilation, bronchospasm, 
atelectasis, and exacerbation of underlying chronic lung disease .  
ii. Possible High dependency/ICU admission, prolonged hospit al stay (average increase of 
1-2 weeks) with increased morbidity and mortality.  
iii. Risk increases with greater number of pulmonary risk factors present.  
 Conditions  How to optimize  
EFS Total score >=6 or  
Functional independence + functional 
performance  score  >=3, going for major 
abdominal surgery  or vascular angioplasty with

- Counsel for regional or local anesthesia preferably over general 
anaesthesia where possible.  
- Continue inhalers pre and postoperatively  and advise patient to 
bring inhalers on day of surgery . 
- Refer  for preoperative prehabiliation  for major  abdominal 
surgery . 
- If patient has COPD GOLD 3 or 4, on long term oxygen therapy, 
mMRC dyspnea scale >2, anaesthesia risk is moderate to high. 
Discuss these cases  with the PEC consultant and RCCM regarding 
preoperative optimization for surgery.  
Asthma  ACT score ≤19  
 
History  of 
requiring 
intubation or non -

ventilation  - Evaluate Asthma Control Test score (ACT) .  
- If ACT score ≤19 (not well controlled), r efer IMPT (if patient is on  
OPS follow -up) or RCCM (if patient is known to them ) for 
optimi sation.  If surgery is non -urgent, discuss postponement with 
PEC consultant and surgeon.  
- Continue inhalers both pre and postoperatively  and advise patient 
to bring inhalers on the day of surgery . 
 
5. PREHABILITATION  
 
a. Prehabilitation  is the process of enhancing an individual’s functional capacity to enable 
him/her to better withstand upcoming surgical stressors. In SGH,  the PeriopeRativE 
PrograAm foR Elderly (PREPARE) encompasses a multimodal approach to target  frail 
elderly patients presenting for elective major abdominal surgery . 
 
b. All preoperative patients >65 years are screened at the Nursing Assessment Counter with  
the Edmonton Frail Scale (EFS) for frailty, and Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool 
(MUST)  for malnutrition risk

• Hypokalemia  hyperaldosteronism  
• Look through available CT abdomen for adrenal masses  
 Refer young hypertensive patients and patients with signs of secondary hypertension to 
IMPT for work up prior to surgery  (discuss with surgeon regarding benefit of 
postponing operation for further work up vs risk of delaying surgery)  
 Low threshold for referral to IMPT for young hypertensives  
 If no suspicion of secondary hypertension, manage as for pre -existing hypertension  
 
PERIOPERATIVE OPTIMIZATION OF MEDICATIONS  
 Continue all anti-hypertensives on the day of operation except ACEi/ARB (refer to below)   
 Take with sip of water at 6am on day of surgery 
 Beta-blockers  
 Patients with ≥ 3 revised cardiac risk index ( RCRI)  factors or intermediate/high cardiac 
risk on preoperative tests, it may be reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery – 
discuss with cardiologist or PEC consultant if it should be started  
 Beta blockers should not be initiated within 24h of surgery 
 Diuretics  
 Watch out for hypokalemia and evaluate patient’s volume status on the day of operation  
 Angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/ Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs)  
 ACEi can cause refractory post induction hypotension if not stopped preoperatively  
 In non-cardiac surgery, consider discontinuation 24 hours preoperatively and restart within 48 hours after operation in patients with well controlled hypertension unless 
clinically contraindicated  
 Continue ACEi preoperatively  if there is impaired LV systolic function or heart 
failure or if BP is poorly controlled

2. Antibiotic prophylaxis  
- IV antibiotics at start of surgery  
 
3. PONV prophylaxis  
- IV Dexamethasone 8mg at start of surgery  if non -diabetic  
- If diabetic  (well controlled HbA1c<8) , change to IV Dexamethasone 4mg  
- If diabetic (poorly controlled HbA1c≥8), to omit. Consider TIVA instead  
- IV ondansetron 8mg at the end of surgery

 New symptoms suggestive of angina or congestive heart failure  
 New onset murmur  
 Change in baseline effort tolerance without apparent cause  
 Abnormal investigations (not previously known or investigated)  
 Changes in ECG suggestive of ischemia or previous infarct  
 Changes in rhythm  
o Left bundle branch block  
o Right bu ndle branch bloc k in symptomatic patients or asymptomatic 
above 50 years old  
o Atrial fibrillation  
o Premature ventricular contractions causing symptoms or in patients 
with underlying structural heart disease, coronary artery disease or low 
ejection fraction  
 
b. Coronary revascularization before non -cardiac surgery  
 Revascularisation before non -cardiac surgery is recommended when indicated by existing 
Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs)  – discuss with cardiologist/PEC consultant if patient 
has previously refused PCI and has persistent symptoms of angina or heart failure  
 Coronary revascularisation is not recommended before non -cardiac surgery exclusively to 
reduce perioperative cardiac ev ents. 
 
c. Valvular heart disease  
 For adults who meet standard indications for valvular intervention (replacement and repair) on 
the basis of symptoms and severity of stenosis or regurgitation, valvular intervention before 
elective non -cardiac surgery is effec tive in reducing perioperative risk.  
 Discuss with PEC consultant if patient  
o Has symptoms of valvular disease  
o Has newly diagnosed severe valvular disease  
o Change from known mild -moderate disease to severe valvular disease that 
has not been investigated  
 
6. MANAGEMENT OF PHARMACOTHERAPY  
 
a. Beta-blockers  
 Beta -blockers should be continued in patients who are already receiving them  
 Patients with ≥ 3 RCRI factors or intermediate/high risk preoperative tests, it may be 
reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery  – discuss with cardiologist or PEC 
consultant if it should be started  
 Beta blockers should not be initiated  within 24h  of surgery

1. PURPOSE  
 To promote individualized assessment and counselling of perioperative cardiac risks for  
patients  listed  for non -cardiac surgery  
 To provide guidelines for referrals and investigations for patients with cardiac conditions going 
for both elective and  emergency surgery  
 To guide pharmacological management of patients on medications for their cardiac conditions  
2. STANDARD  
 Recommendations are based on current best evidence summarized in the references below, 
with consideration of the prevailing practices in  this institution.  
 Management decisions should be based on the individual patient and in consultation with the 
attending surgeon, anesthetist and cardiologist.  
 
3. PERIOPERATIVE CARDIAC ASSESSMENT (ACC/AHA 2014)  
 
Many patients undergoing major non -cardiac surgery are at risk for a cardiovascular event. The 
risk is related to both patient - and surgery - specific characteristics. Identification of any increased 
risk provides the patient, surgeon and anaesthetist with information to formulate risk-benefit ratio 
of the procedure. The surgeon provides surgery -specific risks, and the anesthetists  counsel s for both 
patient - and anaesthesia - specific risks, which can be very different from surgical risks.  
 
Procedure risk str atification  
 
 Life or limb -threatening emergencies  when  there is time for no or limited clinical 
evaluation, typically within 6h : 
i. Proceed, institute measures to maintain coronary perfusion and cardiac 
output  
ii. Refer to CVM for postoperative evaluation and management  
 
 Elective surgery  
i. To consider time frame available for preoperative optimization  
 Time -sensitive procedure: one in which a delay of > 1h to 6 weeks to allow 
for an evaluation and significant changes in management will negatively 
affect outcome  (e.g. malignancy, critical limb ischemia, carotid 
endarterectomy, infections)  
 Elective procedure: procedure could be delayed for up to 1 year

 If no suspicion of secondary hypertension, manage as for pre -existing hypertension  
 
PERIOPERATIVE OPTIMIZATION OF MEDICATIONS  
 Continue all anti-hypertensives on the day of operation except ACEi/ARB (refer to below)   
 Take with sip of water at 6am on day of surgery 
 Beta-blockers  
 Patients with ≥ 3 revised cardiac risk index ( RCRI)  factors or intermediate/high cardiac 
risk on preoperative tests, it may be reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery – 
discuss with cardiologist or PEC consultant if it should be started  
 Beta blockers should not be initiated within 24h of surgery 
 Diuretics  
 Watch out for hypokalemia and evaluate patient’s volume status on the day of operation  
 Angiotension converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/ Angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs)  
 ACEi can cause refractory post induction hypotension if not stopped preoperatively  
 In non-cardiac surgery, consider discontinuation 24 hours preoperatively and restart within 48 hours after operation in patients with well controlled hypertension unless 
clinically contraindicated  
 Continue ACEi preoperatively  if there is impaired LV systolic function or heart 
failure or if BP is poorly controlled

Pre-Operative  
1) Nurse  
- Conduct preoperative education  on post operative recovery goals  such as breathing exercises, early 
ambulation , pain control, early eating and drinking , early removal of IV lines  and drains  and discharge .  
- Baseline EQ5D  
- Ensure that ERAS patient is labelled as such in OT listing under ‘ remarks’ and ‘name of operation’  
2) Anaesthesia evaluation  
- Pre-operative carbohydrate drink to be taken the evening before surgery and 2 hours before surgery if no 
contraindications  (obesity, reflux, di abetes mellitus)  
- Malnutrition screening with MUST (Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool).  
o If patients score >=2 , and there is at least 7 days to surgery , and no preoperative enteral nutrition 
has been ordered by the surgeon , to raise referral to dietitian in PEC for preoperative nutritional 
optimization.  
Intra -Operative  
Before Induction  
- On day before surgery or at team brief with surgeon, discuss regarding  
o central venous catheter (CVC) – if needed for hemodynamic management  
o indwelling catheter (IDC) – if needed for intraoperative and postoperative volume management  
o OGT/NGT – if inserted, whether it can be removed at the end of surgery  
o Postoperative analgesia  
 For open liver surgeries, preperitoneal wound infiltration with LA or insert a wound ca theter 
for LA infiltration (Bbraun OnQ PainBuster), in addition to PCA morphine , is preferred over 
thoracic epidural.  
 For lap liver surgeries, discuss if PCA morphine will be required  
Intraoperative  
1) Volume Management  
 During liver resection, aim for judi cious fluid therapy  
o Maintainence fluid 1 -4ml/kg/h  
o If CVP is high and/or the liver is congested, any of the following can be considered:  
 GTN infusion (starting rates at 0.5mg/h)  
 Increase forward flow of the heart (heart rate/contractility)  
 Diuretics  
 Improve ventilatory mechanics (No/low PEEP, longer I:E ratio, low peak airway pressures, 
mode)  
 Aim to restore normovolemia after the resection phase.

 New symptoms suggestive of angina or congestive heart failure  
 New onset murmur  
 Change in baseline effort tolerance without apparent cause  
 Abnormal investigations (not previously known or investigated)  
 Changes in ECG suggestive of ischemia or previous infarct  
 Changes in rhythm  
o Left bundle branch block  
o Right bu ndle branch bloc k in symptomatic patients or asymptomatic 
above 50 years old  
o Atrial fibrillation  
o Premature ventricular contractions causing symptoms or in patients 
with underlying structural heart disease, coronary artery disease or low 
ejection fraction  
 
b. Coronary revascularization before non -cardiac surgery  
 Revascularisation before non -cardiac surgery is recommended when indicated by existing 
Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs)  – discuss with cardiologist/PEC consultant if patient 
has previously refused PCI and has persistent symptoms of angina or heart failure  
 Coronary revascularisation is not recommended before non -cardiac surgery exclusively to 
reduce perioperative cardiac ev ents. 
 
c. Valvular heart disease  
 For adults who meet standard indications for valvular intervention (replacement and repair) on 
the basis of symptoms and severity of stenosis or regurgitation, valvular intervention before 
elective non -cardiac surgery is effec tive in reducing perioperative risk.  
 Discuss with PEC consultant if patient  
o Has symptoms of valvular disease  
o Has newly diagnosed severe valvular disease  
o Change from known mild -moderate disease to severe valvular disease that 
has not been investigated  
 
6. MANAGEMENT OF PHARMACOTHERAPY  
 
a. Beta-blockers  
 Beta -blockers should be continued in patients who are already receiving them  
 Patients with ≥ 3 RCRI factors or intermediate/high risk preoperative tests, it may be 
reasonable to begin beta blockers before surgery  – discuss with cardiologist or PEC 
consultant if it should be started  
 Beta blockers should not be initiated  within 24h  of surgery

7. There is no need to delay the operation for further medical workup or preoperative optimization.
8. Follow the department's guidelines for preoperative assessment and optimization of patients with respiratory disease. Ensure the patient is adequately educated about the surgery and anesthesia.

Instructions for the patient in lay language:
1. Continue taking all your current medications as usual, but stop smoking immediately until after your surgery.
2. You should not eat or drink anything after midnight on the night before your surgery if it's in the morning. If it's in the afternoon, you should not eat or drink for at least 6 hours before your surgery.
3. You don't need to drink a special carbohydrate drink before surgery.
4. If you have any questions about your medications or smoking, please ask your doctor or nurse.
5. There's no need to delay your surgery, and your healthcare team will take care of everything to ensure your surgery goes well.

Consent for Anesthesia:
You will be given anesthesia to make you sleep during the surgery. Anesthesia is generally safe, but there are some risks like allergic reactions or breathing problems. Given your history of asthma, it's essential to inform the anesthesia team about it. They will take extra precautions to ensure your safety. Smoking increases the risk of complications, so quitting is crucial.

Please let your anesthesia team know if you have any concerns or questions about anesthesia. They will provide you with more detailed information and address any specific concerns you may have.","**Instructions for Medical Colleagues:**

1. **Doctor or Nurse:** Doctor
2. **Fasting Instructions:** Patient should fast for 6 hours for solids and 2 hours for clear liquids prior to the time of surgery.
3. **Suitability for Preoperative Carbohydrate Loading:** No
4. **Medication Instructions:** NA (Patient is not on any long-term medications)
5. **Instructions for the Healthcare Team:** Ensure close monitoring of patient’s hemoglobin levels postoperatively due to history of anemia.
6. **Preoperative Optimization:** 
   - Smoking cessation is recommended. Refer patient to the preoperative smoking cessation counseling sessions.
7. **Delay of Operation:** NA
8. **Department Protocols:**
   - Follow the “Guidelines on Preoperative Assessment of Respiratory Disease” due to the patient's history of smoking and asthma. This is crucial to mitigate the risks of postoperative pulmonary complications.
   - Follow “Enhanced Recovery After Surgery” protocol to aid in a swift and smooth postoperative recovery, considering the patient’s past surgical history and current health status.

**Instructions for Patient in Lay Language:**

1. **Medication Instructions:**
   - You don't need to take any specific medications leading up to the surgery since you're not currently on any long-term medications.

2. **Consent for Types of Anesthesia:**
   - You'll receive anesthesia that will help you sleep and not feel pain during the surgery. Since you have a history of asthma, it’s important to know there might be a slight increase in risks associated with anesthesia, such as breathing difficulties after the surgery. However, these risks are generally low and we'll monitor you closely to prevent and address any issues. Your smoking habit also increases the risk of complications, so we strongly recommend quitting smoking. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask. 

**Additional Note:**
Please take note of any signs of respiratory distress postoperatively due to the patient’s history of asthma and smoking, and address immediately. Also, monitor for signs of anemia postoperatively and manage accordingly. Since the patient has a history of anemia and active smoking, these could potentially affect his recovery, and they should be optimally managed per hospital protocols and guidelines.","Based on the clinical summary provided, the following are the preoperative anesthesia instructions for the patient:
